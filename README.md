Our goal is to make a consol app on c# close to the worldwide known game Hangman.

It is played between you and the computer. It is popular worldwide and is great for both kids and adults, as the game involves logical thinking and strategy.
## 2.How to play Hangman
The computer selects a word that the player (in this case you) has to guess by suggesting letters one at a time.You have a limited number of incorrect guesses (6 by default).Each correct letter fills in the corresponding blanks in the word.The goal is to guess the word before the hangman gets drawn by the computer.
